module Mova
  # Translation keys are usually organized in a tree, where each nesting level
  # corresponds to a specific part of your application. Such hierarchical organization
  # allows to reuse the keys and keep their names relatively short.
  #
  # Full path to a key forms a scope. Think of a scope as a namespace.
  #
  #   # here we have an example YAML file with "blank" keys within different scopes
  #   activemodel:
  #     errors:
  #       blank: Can't be blank
  #       message:
  #         blank: Please provide a message
  #
  # Since Mova is designed to work with any key-value storage, we need to store a key
  # with its own full scope and a locale. We use dot-separated strings as it's a common
  # format in Ruby community.
  #
  #   "en.activemodel.errors.blank"
  #   "en.activemodel.errors.message.blank"
  #
  # @note In YAML (and other storages that map to a hash) you can't store a value
  #   for a nesting level itself.
  #     errors: !can't have translation here
  #       blank: Please enter a value
  #   Other key-value storages usually don't have such limitation, however, it's better
  #   to not introduce incompatibles in this area.
